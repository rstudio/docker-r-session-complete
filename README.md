# docker-r-session
Dockerfiles for R sessions and jobs to be used RStudio Server Pro, Launcher, and
Kubernetes.

## How to Use These Docker Images

The Docker images built from these Dockerfiles are intended to be used for R
sessions and jobs with RStudio Server Pro, Launcher, and Kubernetes.

For more information about RStudio Server Pro and Launcher, refer to the
[Launcher Overview](https://solutions.rstudio.com/launcher/overview/) on the
RStudio Solutions website.

For more information about how to use these images with RStudio Server Pro and
Launcher, refer to the RStudio support article on [Using Docker images with
RStudio Server Pro, Launcher, and
Kubernetes](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019253393-Using-Docker-images-with-RStudio-Server-Pro-Launcher-and-Kubernetes).

## Docker Images on Docker Hub

Built images are available from the
[rstudio/r-session-complete](https://hub.docker.com/r/rstudio/r-session-complete)
repository on Docker Hub.

## Docker Image Layers

These images include the following layers:

* Base OS
* RSP session components
* Some system packages required for R, R packages, and RStudio Professional
  Drivers
* A recent version of R
* R packages (devtools, tidyverse, shiny, and rmarkdown)
* RStudio Professional Drivers

## Release Process for Docker Images

All changes should be made in a PR and merged when the build passes.

When builds on master are passing and you are ready to release a new version of
the image on Docker Hub, you can tag a release on master using the following
steps:

1. Bump versions of RSP session components in Dockerfiles
2. Run the following commands on the `master` branch, editing the version string
   as needed:

```
export VERSION=1.2.1330-2-r-3.5.3
git commit --allow-empty -m "Release for image version ${VERSION}"
git tag -a ${VERSION} -m "${VERSION}"
git push origin ${VERSION}
git push
```

3. The new images will get built on Travis CI and get pushed to Docker Hub
